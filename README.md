About the company: (Our group name for this class)
BusyBee Shipping Solutions is a company that provides a dispatching service (SaaS) to companies
within the supply chain process.

About the project:
BusyBee Shipping Solutions is developing a web application that will provide a portal for
users to access information such as: truck ETAâ€™s, track locations, and help optimize scheduling

1. Through a web portal, a store manager can check what goods are coming
within a shipment by a manifest file provided by the application

2. Users will be able to track the location and arrival times of the trailers through
the web portal, being updated on delays by the driver.

3. A web portal that is accessible by all parties involved in the shipping process,
would allow for information to be kept up-to-date, such as successful delivery.

4. The ability to schedule trucks for deliveries and share that information through
the database
